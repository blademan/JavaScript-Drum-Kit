Hi there!

This repository is created to keep track of my progress in the awesome JavaScript 30 Day Challenge
and commiting & logging what I have learnt on daily basis.

If you have any JavaScript/JavaScript30 course realted queries, please create a new issue [here](https://github.com/blademan/JavaScript-Drum-Kit/issues/new). I will try to respond as soon as possible. I am always happy to help and learn new stuff from our JS community.

Thanks!
